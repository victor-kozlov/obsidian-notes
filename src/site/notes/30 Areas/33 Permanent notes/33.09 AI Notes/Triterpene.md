Triterpenes, a class of natural compounds found in plants and fungi, have shown promising hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects relevant to liver diseases including liver cirrhosis. Various studies indicate several triterpenes such as oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, and triterpenoids from Ganoderma lucidum exhibit beneficial effects on liver fibrosis and cirrhosis models.

Key points from scientific research on triterpenes in liver cirrhosis:

- Triterpenes like oleanolic acid have been used traditionally for liver disorders; they exhibit antioxidant activity, reduce inflammation, and may promote liver cell regeneration.
- Studies in animal models show triterpene extracts inhibit hepatic stellate cell proliferation, a critical driver of liver fibrosis, and reduce collagen deposition, thereby attenuating fibrosis and progression toward cirrhosis.
- Ganoderma lucidum triterpenes have been shown to improve liver biochemistry (lower ALT, AST), inhibit fibrotic markers, and reduce oxidative stress in experimental liver injury models.
- Some triterpenoid compounds also modulate signaling pathways involved in inflammation (e.g., NF-κB, MAPK3) and fibrosis (TGF-β1/Smads), contributing to their anti-fibrotic effects.
- While preclinical data are promising, clinical evidence in humans remains limited but supportive for hepatoprotective potential.
- Dose and safety considerations are important, as high doses of certain triterpenes like oleanolic acid might cause cholestatic liver injury in mice, highlighting the need for balanced therapeutic use.

In summary, triterpenes demonstrate significant anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective effects in various preclinical models of liver cirrhosis. These compounds are considered potential adjunct therapies to slow cirrhosis progression and improve liver function, but more clinical trials are needed for conclusive evidence in humans.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]

If you want, I can provide more detailed information on specific triterpenes or their mechanisms of action in the context of liver diseases.

## Triterpenes and triterpenoid compounds with hepatoprotective evidence in humans

Here is a list of triterpenes and triterpenoid compounds with hepatoprotective evidence in humans or important clinical relevance supported by human 

- **Oleanolic acid**: One of the most studied triterpenes with clinical evidence showing hepatoprotective effects. It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and liver regeneration properties. Oleanolic acid is used in traditional medicine and some human trials suggest it helps in liver function improvement and protection against toxic liver injury.[1][2][3]

- **Ursolic acid**: A pentacyclic triterpene closely related to oleanolic acid, also found in many plants with hepatoprotective and anti-fibrotic properties. Though mostly studied preclinically, it has shown promising effects on liver health linked to antioxidative and anti-inflammatory actions.[4]

- **Glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid)**: A triterpenoid saponin from licorice root, widely used in humans in hepatoprotection, especially in chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis. Glycyrrhizin reduces liver enzymes, inflammation, and fibrosis progression in clinical settings.[5][6][7]

- **Ganoderic acids**: Triterpenoids extracted from Ganoderma lucidum (reishi mushroom), which have demonstrated hepatoprotective effects in human cell studies and some clinical use. These compounds reduce oxidative stress and inflammation linked with liver diseases.[8][7][9]

- **Antcin A**: A triterpene acid from Antrodia camphorata (a medicinal mushroom) with experimental and emerging clinical evidence for reducing liver inflammation and injury in human-relevant models.[10]

- **Synthetic triterpenoids like CDDO-EA (RTA 405)**: These semi-synthetic derivatives have been tested in clinical and animal models, showing liver fibrosis attenuation, anti-inflammatory effects, and delay of cirrhosis progression.[11]

- **Total triterpenes from natural extracts (e.g., Suosuo grape)**: Clinical and preclinical data indicate these triterpenoids have antioxidant and immunomodulatory hepatoprotective effects.[12]

Most of these compounds influence key pathways involved in liver injury such as oxidative stress reduction, inflammation modulation (NF-κB, MAPK), inhibition of hepatic stellate cell activation, and anti-fibrotic effects. While preclinical studies dominate, several have been used in humans supported by clinical trials or traditional use documented with some clinical studies.

If you want, I can provide more detailed information about any specific triterpene, dosing or clinical trial data. 

This summary focuses on triterpenes with at least some clinical or human evidence for hepatoprotection, not just preclinical findings alone.[3][9][5][12][10]

## Clinical trials tested triterpenes for liver disease and their outcomes
Several clinical trials have tested triterpene compounds for liver diseases, with the most notable outcomes summarized below:

1. **Oleanolic Acid**  
- Clinical and preclinical studies show oleanolic acid promotes liver regeneration, reduces liver injury markers, and improves liver function after partial hepatectomy.  
- It acts by activating the pregnane X receptor (PXR), promoting hepatocyte proliferation and antioxidant pathways.[1][2][3]

2. **Glycyrrhizin (Glycyrrhizic Acid)**  
- Multiple clinical studies in patients with liver fibrosis and chronic hepatitis showed glycyrrhizin reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis markers.  
- Mechanisms include inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatic stellate cell activation, and fibrosis-related protein expression.  
- Glycyrrhizin is well tolerated and improves liver function tests in humans.[4][5][6]

3. **Ganoderma lucidum Triterpenoids**  
- Clinical and in vivo studies show Ganoderma triterpenoids improve antioxidant enzyme activity, reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and attenuate liver fibrosis progression.  
- Ganoderma triterpene extracts have shown protective effects in models relevant to human liver disease.[7][8][9]

4. **Synthetic Triterpenoid (CDDO-EA, RTA 405)**  
- Phase II clinical trials and animal models demonstrate this compound slows liver fibrosis progression and lowers fibrosis-related biomarkers in chronic liver disease.  
- Improves survival and reduces complications in toxin-induced liver cirrhosis models.[10][11]

5. **Other Herbal Extracts Rich in Triterpenes**  
- Clinical trials of herbal extracts (e.g., Pueraria lobata) containing triterpenoids also show hepatoprotective potential by reducing inflammation and liver enzyme levels in humans.[12][13]

Summary Table:

| Compound                 | Clinical Evidence                     | Outcomes                                  | Safety/Notes                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Oleanolic Acid           | Liver regeneration after surgery    | Promotes hepatocyte proliferation, PXR activation | Generally safe; dose matters |
| Glycyrrhizin             | Chronic hepatitis, fibrosis trials  | Reduced inflammation, apoptosis inhibition | Well tolerated, widely used  |
| Ganoderma Triterpenoids  | Multiple human studies and extracts | Reduced oxidative stress, fibrosis markers | Safe in traditional use     |
| Synthetic CDDO-EA        | Phase II clinical trials             | Slower fibrosis progression, improved survival | Experimental drug          |
| Herbal Triterpene Extracts | Various clinical studies            | Improved liver function tests, anti-inflammatory | Variable depending on extract |

These clinical trials demonstrate hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of triterpenes in liver diseases, with glycyrrhizin and oleanolic acid being the best studied in humans. Synthetic derivatives show promise in advanced stages of disease.

If you want detailed data from specific trials or dosing info, I can provide it. Otherwise, this summarizes the clinical testing landscape for triterpenes in liver disease.[9][5][6][1][4]
